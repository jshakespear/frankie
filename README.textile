h2. Sinatra Meets Facebook(er)

Frankie is a Facebooker wrapper for Sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com)

Maintained by Justin Smestad (http://www.evalcode.com). This version is not backwards compatible with anything prior to Sinatra 0.9. Original version by Ron Evans has support for older versions of Sinatra and 'classic-style' applications.

Frankie is based on merb_facebooker by Chris Van Pelt.

h2. Sample Application

	require 'rubygems'
	require 'frankie'

  module MyApp < Sinatra::Base
    register Sinatra::Frankie

    configure do
      set_option :sessions, true
      load_facebook_config File.dirname(__FILE_) + "/config/facebooker.yml", Sinatra::Application.environment
    end

    ## facebooker helpers
    before do
      ensure_authenticated_to_facebook
      ensure_application_is_installed_by_facebook_user
    end


	  ## the site
	  get '/' do
	    body "<h1>Hello #{session[:facebook_session].user.name} and welcome to frankie!</h1>"
	  end
  end


h2. Using Frankie

* Install the frankie gem (which will install both Sinatra and Facebooker if you do not already have them)
	sudo gem install frankie

* Create the application directories for your new app
	mkdir myapp
	cd myapp
	mkdir config

* Put your facebooker.yml file into the /lib/<application_name>/config directory, and set the values to your information. Here is a simple example of the file:

	development:
	 api_key: apikeyhere 
	 secret_key: secretkeyhere
	 canvas_page_name: yourcanvashere    
	 callback_url: http://localhost:4567
	test:
	 api_key: apikeyhere 
	 secret_key: secretkeyhere
	 canvas_page_name: yourcanvashere    
	 callback_url: http://localhost:4567
	production:
	 api_key: apikeyhere 
	 secret_key: secretkeyhere
	 canvas_page_name: yourcanvashere    
	 callback_url: http://yourrealserver.com


* Make sure you have setup your Facebook application on the facebook site. Google "setup new facebook application" if you are unsure how to do this. I recommend starting with an IFrame application. A more advanced and cooler approach uses a tunneling script, which is included with Frankie. You do need to have "autossh" installed in order to use it, as well as a publicly addressable server. From a command prompt type tunnel <host> <remote_port> <local_port> like this:

	tunnel app.myhost.com 10000 4567

You will also need to make sure your server's /etc/ssh/sshd_config contains the following line:

	GatewayPorts clientspecified

Thanks to the many people like Evan Weaver, Blake Mizerany, and whoever else that have provided the code used in this tunneling script.

* Create your application, based on the sample above, and then run it:
ruby sample.rb

* Test your app by going to http://apps.facebook.com/yourappname
